      <p>
        In this day and age, understanding data is the key to making the best
        decisions for any business. However, the amount of information that’s
        available at any time can be overwhelming for the most data-savvy
        person.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what’s the key to making data-driven decisions? Finding the most
        important data and formatting it in a way that’s easy to understand.
        This can change, depending on who will view the data. If you’re an
        industry expert, you may find complex data easier to understand. If
        you’re presenting data to less well-versed stakeholders at your company,
        you may need to simplify it before sharing it with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the easiest ways to make data easy to understand for technical
        and non-technical audiences is to create a dashboard that easily
        displays all of your data visualizations in one place. <br />

      <h3>Dashboard definition</h3>
      <p>
        A dashboard is a way of displaying various types of visual data in one
        place. Usually, a dashboard is intended to convey different, but related
        information in an easy-to-digest form. And oftentimes, this includes
        things like key performance indicators (KPI)s or other important
        business metrics that stakeholders need to see and understand at a
        glance. Dashboards are useful across different industries and verticals
        because they’re highly customizable. They can include data of all sorts
        with varying date ranges to help you understand: what happened, why it
        happened, what may happen, and what action you should take. And since
        dashboards use visualizations like tables, graphs, and charts, others
        who aren’t as close to the data can quickly and easily understand the
        story it tells or the insights it reveals.
      </p>
      <h3>How do dashboards work?</h3>
      <p>
        Dashboards take data from different sources and aggregate it so
        non-technical people can more easily read and interpret it. With
        interactive elements, it helps anyone using the dashboard better
        understand certain points, explore areas of increased interest, and
        support more questioning to arrive at key insights or make key
        decisions.
      </p>
      <h3>Dashboard uses</h3>
      <p>
        The main use of a dashboard is to show a comprehensive overview of data
        from different sources. Dashboards are useful for monitoring, measuring,
        and analyzing relevant data in key areas. They take raw data from many
        sources and clearly present it in a way that’s highly tailored to the
        viewer’s needs—whether you’re a business leader, line of business
        analyst, sales representative, marketer, and more.
        <br />
        Use dashboards to measure things like:
        <ul className="list-disc p-4">
          <li>Customer metrics</li>
          <li>Financial information</li>
          <li>Sales information</li>
          <li>Web analytics</li>
          <li>Manufacturing information</li>
          <li>Human resources data</li>
          <li>Marketing performance</li>
          <li>Logistics information</li>
        </ul>
        Since dashboards are useful aggregation and visualization tools, they’re
        highly versatile—used by professionals to analyze complex data or
        subject matter experts to track or present data to non-subject matter
        experts. Use them in your presentations to executives or other key
        stakeholders to help them understand challenges, opportunities, where to
        grow and make changes.
      </p>
      <h3>The importance of dashboards</h3>
      <p>
        Dashboards are important because they provide a platform for people to
        make better, more informed, data-driven decisions. Since they’re
        dynamic, interactive, and show near real-time data, they help you get a
        more precise, in-the-moment understanding of what’s happening in the
        world around you and navigate rapid, sometimes difficult changes.
      </p>
      <h3>How to create a data dashboard</h3>
      <p>
        There are many different solutions to help you build dashboards:
        Tableau, Excel, or Google Sheets. But at a basic level, here are
        important steps to help you build a dashboard:
